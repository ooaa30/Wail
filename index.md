## Welcome to Wail

Wail is a Domain Specific language for modelling the AI in the game Battle for Wesnoth.

Wail was developed for a Final Year project and uses Xtext to aid in this process.

To install the project, simply download a zip of the whole project and import the plugin found within the wailplugin file. This should then give you access to the whole of the language and associated tooling.
